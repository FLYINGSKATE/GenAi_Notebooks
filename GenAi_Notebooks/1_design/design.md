## 11. Project Design Q&A

### Q1: Should we use a pre-trained model or train our own from scratch?
**A:** For most use cases, we recommend starting with a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it for your specific needs. Here's why:
- Pre-trained models already have general language understanding
- Fine-tuning requires significantly less data and compute
- Faster time-to-market
- Lower infrastructure costs

**Consider training from scratch if:**
- You have domain-specific data that's very different from general text
- You need complete control over the training data and process
- You have substantial computational resources

### Q2: What's the best vector database for our RAG system?
**A:** The choice depends on your specific requirements:

| Database  | Best For | Considerations |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Chroma** | Quick prototyping, local development | - Easy to set up<br>- Good for small to medium datasets |
| **Pinecone** | Production, large-scale systems | - Managed service<br>- High performance<br>- Pay-as-you-go pricing |
| **Weaviate** | Complex queries, hybrid search | - Supports multiple vector search algorithms<br>- Built-in ML models |
| **FAISS** | Research, in-memory search | - High performance<br>- No persistence out of the box |

### Q3: How should we handle long documents in our RAG system?
**A:** For processing long documents, consider this approach:
1. **Chunking Strategy**:
   - Use recursive text splitting with overlap (e.g., 1000 chars chunk size, 200 chars overlap)
   - Consider semantic chunking for better context preservation

2. **Document Structure**:
   - Maintain document hierarchy (sections, subsections)
   - Store metadata about the document structure

3. **Retrieval**:
   - Use multi-vector retrieval for better context
   - Consider hybrid search (BM25 + vector similarity)

### Q4: How can we improve the quality of our RAG system's responses?
**A:** Try these techniques:
1. **Query Expansion**:
   - Use LLM to rewrite/expand the query
   - Include relevant context from previous interactions

2. **Post-processing**:
   - Implement response validation
   - Add fact-checking against source documents
   - Filter out hallucinations

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Collect user feedback on response quality
   - Use this to improve retrieval and generation

### Q5: What's the best way to evaluate our RAG system?
**A:** Implement a comprehensive evaluation strategy:

1. **Retrieval Metrics**:
   - Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)
   - Human evaluation of retrieved chunks

2. **Generation Metrics**:
   - BLEU, ROUGE for text similarity
   - BERTScore for semantic similarity
   - Human evaluation of response quality

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Test with real user queries
   - Monitor production metrics
   - A/B test different configurations

### Q6: How should we handle sensitive information in our documents?
**A:** Implement these security measures:
1. **Data Processing**:
   - Redact PII (Personally Identifiable Information) during ingestion
   - Implement access controls at document level

2. **Model Deployment**:
   - Use private endpoints for model inference
   - Implement rate limiting and monitoring

3. **Compliance**:
   - Document data lineage
   - Maintain audit logs of all operations
   - Implement data retention policies
