## 1. Introduction to Prompt Engineering <a name="introduction"></a>

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting inputs (prompts) to effectively communicate with large language models (LLMs) to achieve desired outputs. It's a crucial skill for getting the most out of modern AI systems.

### Why Prompt Engineering Matters
- **Efficiency**: Better prompts yield better results faster
- **Cost**: Optimized prompts reduce API costs
- **Control**: Precise control over model behavior
- **Consistency**: reliable outputs across different scenarios

## 2. Fundamental Concepts <a name="fundamentals"></a>

### Basic Prompt Structure
```
[Instruction] [Context] [Input] [Output Indicator]
```

### Key Components
1. **Instruction**: What you want the model to do
2. **Context**: Background information
3. **Input Data**: The actual input to process
4. **Examples**: Few-shot learning examples
5. **Constraints**: Rules or limitations

### Example: Basic Prompt
```
Translate the following English text to French:
"Hello, how are you?"
```

## 3. Prompt Design Patterns <a name="design-patterns"></a>

### 3.1 Zero-shot Prompting
```
Classify the sentiment of this review: "I loved the new movie!"
```

### 3.2 Few-shot Prompting
```
Text: "This product is amazing!"
Sentiment: Positive

Text: "Terrible service, would not recommend."
Sentiment: Negative

Text: "It was okay, nothing special."
Sentiment: Neutral

Text: "The battery life is impressive!"
```

### 3.3 Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
```
Q: If there are 3 apples and you take away 2, how many do you have?
A: If you take away 2 apples from 3, you have 1 apple left. So the answer is 1.

Q: There are 5 birds in a tree. 2 fly away. How many are left?
A:
```

## 4. Advanced Techniques <a name="advanced-techniques"></a>

### 4.1 Self-consistency
Ask the model to think step by step and provide reasoning.

### 4.2 Generated Knowledge
```
First, generate some knowledge about quantum computing. Then, explain it to a 10-year-old.
```

### 4.3 Least-to-Most Prompting
Break down complex tasks into simpler subtasks.

## 5. LLM-Specific Prompting <a name="llm-specific"></a>

### 5.1 GPT-4
- Handles complex instructions well
- Benefits from detailed context
- Good at following multi-step reasoning

**Example**:
```
You are a helpful assistant that explains complex topics simply. 
Explain quantum computing in 3 sentences or less.
```

### 5.2 LLaMA 2
- More sensitive to prompt formatting
- Benefits from clear instructions
- Works well with system prompts

**Example**:
```
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.
<</SYS>>

Explain quantum computing in simple terms. [/INST]
```

### 5.3 Claude
- Excels at following complex instructions
- Good at role-playing
- Handles long contexts well

**Example**:
```
Human: Explain quantum computing like I'm five.

Assistant:
```

## 6. Best Practices <a name="best-practices"></a>

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the task
2. **Use Examples**: Include relevant examples
3. **Set Constraints**: Define output format and length
4. **Iterate**: Test and refine prompts
5. **Consider Context**: Provide necessary background

## 7. Common Pitfalls <a name="pitfalls"></a>

- **Vagueness**: Unclear instructions
- **Overloading**: Too many tasks in one prompt
- **Bias**: Unintended bias in prompts
- **Hallucination**: Model making up information

### Key Differences Between LLMs

| Feature | GPT-4 | LLaMA 2 | Claude |
|---------|-------|---------|--------|
| Context Length | 8K-32K tokens | 4K-32K tokens | 100K+ tokens |
| Prompt Style | Natural language | Instruction-based | Conversational |
| Strengths | General knowledge | Open-source | Long-context |
| Best For | General use | Custom deployments | Long documents |

Remember: The best prompt is one that's been tested and refined for your specific use case and model.
